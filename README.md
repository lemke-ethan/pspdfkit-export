# pspdfkit-instantJson

To run this demo, clone the repository and then, within it, run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The React app should launch in the browser at localhost:3000.  Click the button
on the left to load a PDF with an InstantJson with a "highlight" attribute
containing an attribute Id.  Click the button on the right to load the same pdf
with the same InstantJson but with the attribute id omitted.  Check the console
in Chrome dev tools to see the error on the second one.
